# Elegant Theme

This is a fork from [Mudassir's theme](https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant)
a responsive theme for [JsonResume](https://jsonresume.org/) inspired by card layouts.

### Why the fork?
I like the theme a lot. It has many nice little details.
One of them is the calculated duration for each of your work experience entries.

However Mudassir focuses on serving your resume with his theme through 
[the official registry](http://registry.jsonresume.org/).
If you render your resume yourself or use something like [HackMyResume](http://please.hackmyresume.com),
your displayed work experience duration will never be updated and become wrong eventually.
See [related issue](https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant/issues/83).

That is why I decided to fork the theme and ensure that it is just as good when used
without the official jsonresume registry.
